-- The pin-provenance report (spec §3): every SQL-expressible pinned
-- calibration constant, recomputed from the committed fixture and compared
-- to the value pinned in windows/lab/tests/calibration.rs. Duplication is
-- deliberate — an independent second path from fixture to pin, written
-- against the raw CSV-backed views rather than the Rust MetricValue model.
-- When a pin re-pins in Rust (a re-baseline), update the literal here IN THE
-- SAME COMMIT — the golden-pins mismatch is the tripwire that catches a
-- forgotten half of a re-pin. (Catch-up 2026-07-16, regen 945f62b: this file
-- had silently missed every calibration.rs re-pin since its creation —
-- census-check was not being run at re-pin time. All literals below were
-- resynced to calibration.rs in the epoch-v4 re-pin commit.)
-- (Resync 2026-07-20, The Demesne / BIO-35 Stage 1 local regen on lefford:
-- the genesis-changing per-axis supply moved the census; all 16 drifted
-- literals below were re-synced to calibration.rs in this same commit.)
--
-- Counts and exact structural zeroes compare with `computed = pinned`;
-- quantized means/SMDs compare with `abs(computed - pinned) < 1e-6` (the
-- fixture's floats passed `quantize`, 8 significant digits, at the
-- ledger-commit boundary — see CLAUDE.md's Determinism section).
--
-- NOT translated here (Rust-only; the source test is still the first path,
-- this file just doesn't add a second one for these):
--   * band_count_matches_the_known_function_of_rotation,
--     flagship_subsistence_matches_biome_and_coastal_columns,
--     pantheon_verticality_matches_stratification,
--     head_deity_is_eternal_exactly_when_tidally_locked,
--     kobold_structures_never_enslave_and_top_out_with_elders,
--     the_slave_rung_is_an_exact_function_of_rank_surplus_and_scale
--     — per-row structural invariants (day-length thresholds, the
--     biome+coastal -> subsistence mapping, a role-string top-rung check)
--     with no single re-pinned literal to duplicate; SQL would just restate
--     the same predicate the Rust loop already checks every commit, not add
--     an independent path to a MEASURED value.
--   * kobold_flagships_are_less_coastal_than_goblin_flagships,
--     obliquity_range_is_wider_on_moonless_worlds
--     — directional-only claims (a strict inequality between two computed
--     means), no exact literal pinned.
--   * phonotactic_validity_is_true_for_every_generated_name,
--     epithet_honorific_is_true_for_goblin_and_false_for_kobold,
--     name_gloss_true_is_100_percent_row_by_row,
--     lexicon_is_regular_and_exposure_sound_for_both_species
--     — boolean invariants that hold 100%/0% by construction (grammar,
--     morph_options, name-gloss truthfulness, exposure soundness); no
--     drifting literal, and re-deriving "is this name valid" needs the
--     phonotactic/lexicon machinery itself, not just the fixture.
--   * census_fixture_matches_live_run — the `#[ignore]`d heavy live-rerun
--     guard, not a calibration constant.
--   * null_control_blind_attribution_is_at_chance's `picks_twin` — implied
--     by `decided = 0` below (no decided pairs to pick from); not
--     independently re-derived.
--   * null_control_distributions_are_within_the_sampling_bound's directional
--     bounds (TVD < 0.15, |SMD| < 0.2) — sampling-theory margins, not
--     re-pinned measurements; only the file's exact STRUCTURAL zero pins are
--     translated below.
